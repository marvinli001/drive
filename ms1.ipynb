## Colab

1. Online GPU, deep learning model, training faster

2. Access to Google Drive

3. Buy the Pro version, higher level GPU

4. VPN access

5. If you disconnect, then all variable will be lost

## Jupyter Notebook

1. Do not need internet connect, local computer

2. If you have large data(especially image, video), then saving and loading from local computer is usually faster than Colab

3. package version/package compatibility

## Pycharm

1. .py file

## other platform

1. the start has to be a character or a '_'
